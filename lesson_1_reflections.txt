command manuals control : diff old_file new_file

in term easy acces to the entire history of a file make me a more efficient programmer b'se it helps me correcting any occured problemin fex clicks

cos of manually commit : u may forget to commit  pros : u make a meaningful and logical commit

why do you think some version control systems, like git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like google docs, treat each file separately ?:

saving mutliple files may have cons. maybe u may not want to save only one file or maybe is a matter of memory economies  !

how can you us the commands git log git diff to vieuw the history of files ?: 

git log shows all history of commits (use of arrow keys maybe necessary ) the with git diff u cant view difference between two files

how might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something ?
 there is always a chance to comme back so making error is not a problem if u make an error u cant' fix just go back to interior state-> problem solved !

 now that i have my workspace set up, what do i want to try git for ? : make a projet and doing as many changes as i want without worring about it to break up !
