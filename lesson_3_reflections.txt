c'est ici que je vais mettre mes notes de reflections !

when would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?:
when u wan to be able to acces to work every where by internet or if u share you work with peaple so that every body can get acces to it

decribe the defferences betwen forks, clones and branches. when would you use one instead of onother ?:
forks create a copy of the  repo on your github it stays online clones make a copy of the repo on your local machine, branches on in a repo represents differente version of commits

what is the benefits of having a compy of the kast knwon state of the remote stored locally 
?: so that when u make changes locally u can merge branches locally before u push them 

how would you collaborate without using git or github ? wht would be easier, and what would ne harder ? : we could just send our docs by  email ! or any other means of sharing docs! it is more intuitive u would not have to learn all these new commands !! however it would be  hard to keep track of changes which is very important si better use git/github hein !

when would you want to make changes in separate branch rather than directly in master ? wht benefits does each approach have ?

making changes in master branch is more easier u juste have to pull/push however for an important projet it's better to make changes on different branch before making those changes to master for security matter to avoid un necessary risks !
